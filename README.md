# TrialSubmission

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.5.0.

This project has no back end, instead all HTTP calls are mocked using the `angular-in-memory-web-api`. Modify the [data service](https://github.com/jabrah/flo-start/blob/master/src/app/data/data.service.ts) to add real API calls.

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server then open `http://localhost:4200/` in your browser to view the in development app. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
